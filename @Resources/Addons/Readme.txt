; Version 4 - Sep 12, 2011
;
; RainRGB when called with the appropriate command line parameters will open a standard Windows color picker dialog.
; It will then change the desired color variable in the [Variables] section of any .inc / ini file and refresh either
; a single config or all when completed.  This can be used in combination with @Include files to have a way to set
; the colors for an entire suite of skins, or with an individual .ini file to set the colors for a single skin.
;
; RainRGB4.exe may reside in any folder.
;
; Usage:
; RainRGB4.exe VarName=xxx FileName=xxx Alpha=xxx RefreshConfig=xxx
; 
; Example as called from Rainmeter:
; SomeAction=!Execute ["#ADDONSPATH#RainRGB\RainRGB.exe" "VarName=MyTextColor" "FileName=#CURRENTPATH#UserVariables.inc" "Alpha=200" "RefreshConfig=RainRGB"]
; You MUST put quotes around the call to the executable and each parameter.
;
; VarName REQUIRED
; Name of the variable you wish to set in the .inc / ini file.  It must not contain spaces or use the # character.
; The variable must be defined in the .inc / .ini file under [Variables]
; 
; FileName REQUIRED
; Full path and name of the .inc or .ini file you wish to change.  RainRGB will read the file, and look for 
; an entry for VarName in the [Variables] section.
;
; Alpha OPTIONAL
; Must be a decimal number from 0-255. Do not use hex numbers for this.  If the entry in the .inc / ini file is in hex,
; RainRGB will detect this and convert as needed.  This entire parameter may be left off if desired.  If the entry in 
; the .inc / ini has an alpha value on the setting, it will be preserved if you do not specify Alpha on this command line.
; 
; RefreshConfig OPTIONAL
; This is the name(s) of the Rainmeter config (ex: Enigma\Sidebar) you wish to refresh after the variable has been set.
; If this entire parameter is left off, all currently loaded configs will be refreshed.  You may specify multiple configs
; to refesh by using " | " as a separator.  Example: "RefreshConfig=JSMorley\JSClock | JSMorley\JSWeather".  The spaces 
; before and after the "pipe" character are required.
;
; Notes:
; 
; The variable must already exist in the .inc / ini file under [Variables] and be set to some value.  This addon is to change
; variables, not create them.

; If the setting in the .inc / .ini file is in hex currently (ex: MyColor=FFFFFF or MyColor=FFFFFFFF) RainRGB will preserve this 
; format.  If the current setting in the .inc / ini is in RGB (ex: MyColor=255,255,255 or MyColor=255,255,255,255) RainRGB will
; preserve that format.
;
; To leave a parameter off, remove the entire "ParmName=ParmValue" entry. Do not set the parameter to "" (NULL) to achieve this.
; For example to call the addon without changing the alpha value, and refreshing all skins instead of a specific one:
; SomeAction=!Execute ["#ADDONSPATH#RainRGB\RainRGB.exe" "VarName=MyTextColor" "FileName=#CURRENTPATH#UserVariables.inc"]
; Remember that VarName and FileName are REQUIRED.  RainRGB will just silently exit without making any changes if they are missing.
